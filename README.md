# Bouncing_Ball
Bouncing Ball is a classic arcade-style game developed in Python using the Pygame library. The player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen to keep a bouncing ball from falling off the screen. The objective is to score points by hitting the ball with the paddle while the ball speed and difficulty increase progressively as you score more.
